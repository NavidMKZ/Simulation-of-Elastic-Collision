## Elastic Collision Simulation
This Python code simulates the elastic collision of two spheres considering the impact parameter. It visualizes the collision in both laboratory and central mass fram, showing the trajectories of the spheres.

## Features
* Elastic Collision Simulation: Simulates the collision of two spheres with a given radius and impact parameter.

* Visualization: Provides 3D visualization of the collision.

* Interactive Controls: Choose between laboratory and central mass fram for the simulation.

### Prerequisites
Python 3

VPython library for 3D visualization

### Program Modes
* LAB System: Simulates the collision in the laboratory system.

* CM System: Simulates the collision in the center-of-mass system.

### Impact Parameter
The impact parameter can be chosen between -3 and 3.
